# About Me

Born and raised in the New York City area, I'm thrilled to be back in my hometown studying for my **Master of Science in Biostatistics (Theory & Methods track) at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics)**. 

Healthcare has interested me since I was a teenager; when I was 13, I volunteered at Miami Children's Hospital and took a genetics course through Johns Hopkins University. Instantly, I was awestruck by what I saw, even then, as the potential for **precision medicine**. My education and career since then have been geared towards turning that vision into a reality: first as a **Harvard** undergraduate, then during my first Master's degree at the **University of Cambridge**, where I studied in a [joint program](https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/postgraduates-tab/mphil-mbe) between the Department of Biotechnology and Judge Business School.

My career is broadly divided into two parts: the first in drug development and life sciences, and the second in the technology space. I've been privileged to work for companies ranging from **[Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) (portfolio strategy) to [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) (healthcare investment banking) to [Scentbird](https://www.scentbird.com/) (customer analytics)**. Most recently, I was the first non-engineer hire at [Recidiviz](https://www.recidiviz.org/), a tech nonprofit founded by ex-Googlers focused on improving outcomes for justice-involved individuals to minimize the footprint of our justice system. I'm still lucky to contribute there part-time.

Outside of school, you can usually find me:

* Reading and [writing](https://www.amazon.com/Zachary-Katz/e/B00JW6TQP8/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1) creatively (I'm hard at work on a novel)
* Acquainting myself with machine learning / artificial intelligence techniques (typically through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python))
* Practicing the cello and piano (I've served as Principal Cellist of the Cambridge University Symphony Orchestra, Oxford University Orchestra, and [Mozart Society Orchestra](https://mozartsocietyorchestra.com/) at Harvard)
* Volunteering for LGBT causes, most recently with the [SF LGBT Center](https://www.sfcenter.org/)
* Checking out the latest and greatest ethnic cuisine that New York has to offer with my husband, Nathaniel
